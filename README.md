# my-random-coding-projects
Random coding projects that I've made over the years. Many of these are broken.

This repository is a personal archive of my coding journey. I am not looking for contributions, bug reports, or pull requests at this time. Please feel free to look at the code for inspiration, but it is provided "as-is.

## Automatic_Minecraft_Mods_Updater
It will automatically update the mods in your `.minecraft` folder from [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/). Replace the directories in the files with the full path to your `.minecraft` folder. I would provide documentation, but I have no clue how it works either.

## HiLo_Discord_Bot
This is a discord bot that lets you play the "Higher or Lower?" game based on how popular two [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/) mods are. Replace the token in the files with your Discord bot token. You'll probably need to grant the bot administrator access to be able to play.

## Notes Taking App
A simple HTML app to take notes. I don't think it actually saves your notes though...

## NYC_Hotdog_Solver
This program is made for the [Hot Dog NYC minigame](https://race-around-the-world.fandom.com/wiki/New_York#Final_Challenge:_Ellis_Island) in the Roblox game [Race Around the World](https://www.roblox.com/games/8147712744/Race-Around-The-World). It helps to solve the challenge quickly and efficiently. The X's mean to select that square, and the _'s means to not select that square.

## Password_Generator
A simple HTML app to generate random passwords. Not customisable.

## Platformer_PyGame
A platformer written using the PyGame library that barely works. If you move while on a platform, you die for some reason. I like to accept it as a feature and as extra difficulty.
